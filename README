Environment to experiment with NVMe-TCP
This creates 2 CentOS VM, 1 NVMe target and 1 NVMe-TCP initiator.

Quickstart:
[user@host ~]$ sudo yum install -y vagrant
[user@host ~]$ git clone https://github.com/bganne/nvme-tcp
[user@host ~]$ cd nvme-tcp
# this will fail because of the reboot for the new kernel on the target
[user@host ~]$ vagrant up
# this will fail because of the reboot for the new kernel on the initiator
[user@host ~]$ vagrant up
# VMs are ready, restart everything to a clean state
[user@host ~]$ vagrant reload
[user@host ~]$ vagrant ssh initiator
[vagrant@nvme_tcp-initiator ~]$ sudo nvme list
